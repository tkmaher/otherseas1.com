    new entry("Story", "8-26-2025",
    `In a country far from here, in a place now distant, in a time without memory, there lived an emperor with a castle most majestic.
    <br><br>
    The walls of the castle were taller than the mountains. Its courtyards were swathed in every variety of flower, and were home to animals without name. Its gardens stretched to the horizon, and its battlements stretched to the sea. It was said that an anvil dropped from the highest parapet would fall seven days before reaching the Earth, and seven more before reaching the depths of the castle’s deepest dungeon. 
    <br><br>
    The wonders of the Emperor’s palace were kept in their eternal resplendence by an enchanted crown. Mystes aver that as long as the emperor wore it, no entropy could hope to possess his spires and courtyards. But it was whispered that, if he were to take it off, the entire kingdom would crumble to dust.
    <br><br>
    One day, a cloaked traveller from beyond the hills appeared at the gates of this great palace. The officer of the gate looked him up and down, and asked him his province. “I seek audience with the king,” said the traveller. The officer paused. “You may enter,” he replied, “but I cannot guarantee you will find that which you seek.” With a snap of his fingers, the officer opened the gates and directed the stranger down a shining path encrusted with jewels. Without a word, the traveller walked through.
    <br><br>
    The traveller, driven by desire, hastened down the path. Certain ulterior motives had brought him to the castle. He had spent his years on Earth making a name for himself as a thief. Having heard whispers of the emperor’s wondrous crown, he had come to claim it as his own. The officer’s lack of suspicion at the palace gates had unnerved him. Still, he ventured further into the grounds.
    <br><br>
    After walking for hours and passing countless treasures, the traveller noticed that the sun was beginning to set. He still seemed no closer to the distant spires of the palace proper. So, he laid his supplies down on velvet grass and rested without dreams.
    <br><br>
    The next day, he spied a peacock in a bush. It turned away from him, showing a thousand open eyes. He realized that he had yet to see a single soul in these gardens. Still, he pressed on.
    <br><br>
    The thief continued to walk. He lost track of the days. He felt as if he was traveling backwards. His only companion was his mirrored reflection in the countless, brilliant fountains. Flowers of many colors leered on every side. One day, looking down at his feet, he noticed that the grass had turned to brick. He had reached the foothills of the palace itself, a winding maze of alleys and outposts. Glancing up, he saw a small figure dart into a side street; when he gave chase, he found only a dead end.
    <br><br>
    He climbed up spiral staircases, through reverberant halls, across countless moats and bridges, and past stained glass windows most ornate. The moon above waxed and waned again and again, but the thief ignored his hunger and thirst. His mind was set on his quarry. 
    <br><br>
    With little strength left, he arrived at the base of the greatest tower. He climbed its wide stone steps, hewn of obsidian, and passed through double doors taller than the tallest tree. Therein lay the throne room. A beam of light, flecked with dust, shone upon the throne of the emperor, but the man himself was nowhere to be seen. Upon the throne instead lay the crown.
    <br><br>
    The thief rushed to pick it up, stumbling over his own ragged cloak. He looked down at his hands, and noticed for the first time how wizened and knotted their backs were. He took the crown off of the throne, placed it upon his head, and collapsed into the seat. His eyes closed like heavy doors. He felt that he would be sitting there for a long time to come.

    new entry("The Men Who Carefully Weave Dreams", "10-30-2025",
    `These events took place many years ago. It was around this time that I was living in an apartment building holding many floors. Each floor contained one apartment. I lived on the one-thousandth and twenty-third floor. Above me lived the men who carefully weave dreams.
	I do not remember if the men came to live in the apartment above me before or after I came to live in mine, for there is no time I can recall when they were not living there and I was not living below them. However, they never occupied such grand real estate in my mind until just before the time of this story’s happening. Around this time, I had recently begun a gravely important project that involved the careful numeration of every star in the night sky. Because of the Earth’s revolution under the firmament and a phenomenon known as axial precession, there was no night during which I was not counting and re-counting, drawing tally marks across the walls and all over my body. The task became so totally consuming that I was forced to abandon my diurnal habits, purely for the sake of my own health. I would sleep during the day and count stars at night. It was after a few weeks of this that I found myself regularly awoken from my sun-kissed slumber by faint noises that came from above. There is no singular word that could accurately express the character of these noises. However, they fell into a few distinct categories. For example:
    <br><br>
    The noise that sounded like jointed bones sliding around in sockets.<br>
    The noise that sounded like silverfish crawling across eyelashes.<br>
    The noise that sounded like many colors combining to make one putrid brown hue.<br>
    The noise that sounded like the bob of a pendulum tracing an arc but never reaching its zenith.<br><br>

	(Etc.)
    <br><br>
    Of course, I knew that weaving dreams is no easy task. In fact, I had always admired these men for their steadfast commitment to their art, and I understood that these noises were simply its necessary byproduct. However, it came to a point where even the slightest reverberation from upstairs would wrest me from my slumber. I began to stay up even when it was entirely silent, for fear that I might fall asleep and be consequently awakened. Sleep, once my most steadfast friend, became a licentious maiden whose touch I pined for. At night, the numbers in my head would become confused and confounded with one another, and my tally marks, whose veracity I had once been so sure of, seemed to shift and disappear behind my back. Indeed, it had come to a point where the art of the men upstairs was interfering with my own. One day, I decided something had to be done, so I climbed up the building’s central stairwell to the floor above me. By some effect of the apartment’s insulation or another acoustic idiosyncrasy, the noises from the men’s apartment were significantly louder on their own floor than on mine. If the noises that had been perturbing my rest were like whispers, the noises on this floor, fully clear and amplified, had the loudness of a jet engine or a thunderclap. Being slightly unnerved, I nevertheless walked up to the apartment door and knocked loudly. Even though the knock was totally drowned out by the din, something unusual happened: almost immediately, the noises coming from within the apartment ceased. I waited for a time, but nobody came to the door. After knocking some more, I left, satisfied that I had been successful in quelling the horrible sounds. As I thought about it more, however, misgivings began to foment within me: why had the men refused to come to the door? Why had the sounds stopped immediately after I knocked? Could it be that nobody was in the apartment at all? I thought it best to ignore these thoughts, as sleep, faithful once more, beckoned me to enjoy her pleasures. I had scarcely closed my eyes when I entered into a restful slumber, the likes of which I had not enjoyed in weeks.
    <br><br>
    I found myself in a beige wheat field under a dark gray sky. A brisk wind pierced my flesh, and I noticed that the plants in the field had all withered away. Before me was a ladder, which led down a hole into the earth. To escape the frigid environs, I chose to climb down it. The ladder terminated in a subterranean hallway of crude design, dimly lit by no apparent source. As my eyes adjusted, I started at what I saw: two rows of human figures lined each side of the hallway, their faces pressed close against the earthen walls. Each man stood about ten paces from the men to his left and right. They were uniformly hairless and muscular, with a sickly yellow skin tone. My own body appeared similar to theirs, but I was not sure if it had always appeared this way or if this was some kind of new development. The hallway curved slightly, such that its terminus was never visible. I ventured forward to see if any changes would present themselves, but came to find that the rows of men continued ad infinitum. All attempts to communicate with them proved fruitless. When I stood closely to one of them in order to observe his face, his head quickly snapped away from me, only returning to its former position once I had stepped away. I strode over many leagues, but observed little change in the hallway beyond a slight darkening of its eerie light. Finally, I saw something amiss: there were two men standing unusually far apart from one another, with a gap between them that could easily accommodate a third. Without hesitation, I stepped into the gap and placed my face against the wall. 
	<br><br>When I awoke, the stars had come out. Despite it being the hour of my industry, I couldn’t bring myself to begin the night’s tally. Something about the dream—no, it would be more apt to call it a nightmare—had shaken my spirit. My mind instantly turned to the unusual events of the past day and my attempt to silence the men upstairs. I was struck by a grim realization: the men were unquestionably the ones behind my horrific nightmare! I rushed outside to call the police. I knew that a public telephone was located on the first floor of the building. However, when I arrived at the stairwell, I found that the level of the sea had risen through the stories of the apartment building to lap at my feet. Given that there was no other telephone and no alternative form of egress, I decided that I had to confront the men directly. I marched up the stairs and banged resolutely on their door.
	<br><br>“Cowards! Terrorizers! Tormentors!” I cried. “You devils, who disregard the fundamental tenets of etiquette! I may be just a man, but I, like all men, deserve a basic level of respect! To disregard this right is to disregard reason, morality, and all the things that separate us from common beasts! You have trespassed upon my psyche! You have committed a total violation of my mind, worse than the worst of the corporeal crimes, and you must rightly atone!”
	<br><br>I continued to knock on the door. After a few minutes, I heard footsteps on the other side. The door opened a crack, but the chain of the deadbolt was fastened. I sensed the presence of a man but could not see him. After a moment, a deep yet reserved voice resounded from within:
	<br><br>“Could you please be quiet?” said the voice. “We are trying to sleep.”
	<br><br>His curt reply made my blood boil. “You’re trying to sleep? I’ve been trying to sleep for the past month, to no avail! Your horrible noises have kept me awake to the point of madness. You’re probably cooking up more nightmares to send to other poor souls, no doubt. I won’t be quiet. I’ll make as much noise as I want!”
	<br><br>The man seemed to pause. I heard whispers beyond the door but couldn’t make anything out. After a time, he said:
	<br><br>“It would be best if you left now.” 
	<br><br>“That’s ridiculous!” I exclaimed. “I won’t leave until you issue me an apology and swear to stop trespassing on my mind.”
	<br><br>He paused again. “Well,” he began, “it seems that you have some kind of stubborn fixation concerning us and our labor, and that you aren’t one to go away easily. I will begin by saying that we will not, under any circumstances, be issuing you an ‘apology.’ Our work, unlike your facile star-counting, is important work. It is essential work. It is infinitely complex. Perhaps you think you understand its import, its essence, its complexity, simply because you have experienced a few thousand dreams in your short life. This notion is entirely laughable. Without our dreams, the world would cease to spin, and the stars you so naïvely idolize would all blink out. We, the servants of dreams, uphold a sacred duty. To apologize for performing our duty would be totally out of the question, don’t you see? It would be an affront to all that is good and right. How can you claim to know anything about our work? Only we dream-servants understand its true nature. Perhaps you see the shiny exteriors of dreams and fancy yourself their scholar, but you are infinitely far from any true knowledge of the object. It’s like claiming to have knowledge of a clock without understanding the ticking of the gears inside, or without even knowing that those gears exist. I don’t want to spend too many words trying to explain things to you that you won’t get, but even the gears within dreams have gears, and those gears likewise. No matter how far into the thing you look, you will never really comprehend its totality. Please, don’t try to enter into matters that you will never understand! You’ll only embarrass yourself. Be content with the knowledge that you and all the other fools of this world are cattle, and our dreams are the slaughterhouse. Now, it’s time for you to leave. I have spoken long enough, and I prefer not to waste my breath on madmen.”
    <br><br>I was taken aback by the dream-weaver’s bare contempt. I tried to form a reply. “But,” I sputtered, “what about the nightmare? I don’t want any more dreams like that!”
    <br><br>The man let out an exasperated sigh. “You aren’t satisfied with my explanation? Very well,” he continued. “We are not going to cease interfering with your mind. We will continue to provide you with dreams at our own discretion. You call it ‘trespassing’—it is really anything but! You fancy your mind your own, but if it can be so easily molded and influenced by us, it is more rightly ours. It’s clear from your indignation that you’ve been obsessing over us for months, but all you’ve done is open yourself entirely to us and duly invite us in. Concerning the so-called ‘nightmare’ you had the privilege of witnessing: it is a rare occurrence that a lowly individual such as yourself receives a dream directly tailored for him. In fact, if you were wise, you would be groveling at our feet, thanking us for choosing to enlighten your stupid, thoughtless mind with such a wonderful dream. But you are not wise, and you instead take offense at our gift. That’s the other thing about you—you speak of ‘reason’, ‘morals’, and ‘etiquette’ as if they were objective things that exist somewhere in this world, but you treat them merely as rhetorical toys that exist only to prop up your misguided reason! Your own breaches of etiquette—interrupting our craft, deriding our wonderful dream, banging on our door in the middle of the night—seem to be totally OK in your twisted framework of relativistic morals. You mention our crimes — what are those? Making almost imperceptible noises (during the daylight hours, mind you)? Sending you a beautiful dream specifically crafted for your own pleasure? Yes, for this, we must be eternally penitent. Apology is not enough! Hang us! Kill us! Even in death, we wouldn’t be able to atone for such heinous transgressions. No, in choosing to deride us, you’ve only revealed your own stupidity. Hopefully, my words have shed some light on your rational failings, but I doubt that they will lead to any true self-reflection on your behalf. Good night!”
	<br><br>The man slammed the door shut, and silence returned to the hallway. In a daze, I walked back to my apartment and decided that it would be for the best if I counted some stars, if only to take my mind off the man’s callous words. However, when I looked out the window, I couldn’t see anything. To my dismay, I realized that the ocean had risen up to swallow the sky.

    `We walked down an unpaved road between two fields of gray mud. The sun cast down its pale light upon everything in equal measure. An opaque fog demarcated the borders of the scene, as if the hand of a great minister had drawn it just so. We walked and walked. A gray man appeared out of the fog: he was walking in the opposite direction, carried along by an exaggerated limp. His sluggish trudging did well to complement our hastiness. He was muttering to himself as he passed, but the words were too quiet to discern. “What a grotesque man,” I thought to myself. “I’m glad he doesn’t seem to be interested in conversation.” As if he had heard my thoughts, the man’s footsteps suddenly stopped. From behind us came a voice: 
    <br><br>“Why don’t you ask me what I’m muttering about?”
    <br><br>Without pause, we replied:
    <br><br>“No.”
    <br><br>We had many miles to go, and had no time to get wrapped up in the words of highwaymen. The gray sun was beginning to set. But our response proved insufficient; we heard a squelch as the man limped back in our direction. I turned to face him. We stood in silence for a moment. To our collective dismay, he began to speak:
    <br><br>“I am a person of the mud. In my village, people breathe mud as fish breathe water. Our language is the language of mud. Because our language is the language of mud, there is no word for mud in our language. A mirror cannot reflect itself. However, I will not speak that language to you today. I will continue to speak to you using your own language, which I learned just now from the darting of your eyes. When I was muttering, I was muttering in the language of mud. Now that I speak, I speak in your language. But what I just said is false. There is only one language being spoken here, and I will explain why. Suppose that there are two distinct languages. We will call them Language 1 and Language 2. For these two languages to be truly distinct, they must be independent of one another. This seems like a simple requirement, but I will explain how unreasonable it really is. Independence implies separation on every level. This means that the phonetic and syntactic structures of the two languages must be totally dissimilar; indeed, their respective semantic sets cannot overlap. Meaning: no word in Language 1 has a semantic equivalent in Language 2, and vice versa. However, they are still not really separate. Someone who speaks Language 1 could use a word from Language 2 in order to describe something that lacks a definition in his own language, just as I used your word for ‘mud’ earlier to describe the local medium. This is because, even though their contents are totally discrete, our languages share common symbols. It follows that we must further divide the languages with respect to expression. Let us say that Language 1 is only expressible through speech, while Language 2 is only expressible through writing. But this is still insufficient: it turns out that the speakers of Language 2 are creative, and decide to assign arbitrary symbols to the sounds that come from the mouths of the speakers of Language 1. The barriers have once again been broken, and the languages seep into one another. As long as the speakers can perceive the other language, this transference will continue. Therefore, we must impose a final, terrible stipulation upon our system: the speakers of Language 1 must be unable to discover the existence of Language 2 by any means, and the speakers of Language 2 likewise. No organ or instrument of science possessed by the speakers of Language 1 must be able to perceive the symbols of Language 2. If someone of Language 1 encounters an individual of Language 2, they will think him mute and illiterate. These conditions also apply to speakers of Language 2. For each speaker, the language of the other becomes a language of pure being. The only quality of the language of the other is that it has none, a quality it shares with non-being. So, for each speaker, the other language does not exist, and there is only one language: their own. Let us return to our first proposition concerning two distinct languages. I have shown that the notion of truly isolated languages is absurd, and will always collapse into a single language and a language of non-being, i.e. a single language. However, you may be wondering: what about the actually existing languages of the world, which appear so different and multifarious? They may not be totally distinct, yet are still seemingly separate from one another. This is a valid query. Indeed, the notion of these ‘non-distinct languages’ (unlike the notion of ‘distinct languages’) is not absurd. It is just another way of describing a single language, and therefore fails to imply true plurality.”
    <br><br>During his monologue, the man had been standing about two feet in front of me. He kept extending a mud-encrusted hand forward to pilfer the heavy coins I keep in my pockets, a rote action which seemed totally divorced from any of the words coming out of his mouth. He moved so slowly that the motion of his hand was imperceptible, like that of a plant growing. Every time it came near, I swatted it away with great force, but this didn’t deter him: after shamefully returning his hand to its starting position, he would invariably start the entire process again.
    <br><br>“But why is the notion of ‘non-distinct languages’ misguided? I have already shown you, but I will reiterate: any apparent difference between non-distinct languages can be negated through translation. Translation is the unification of language. This is self-explanatory. Translation effectively creates a union of two languages based on similarities between their constituent words, syntax, or form (here, we understand ‘translation’ as encompassing not just the decryption of semantic meaning between two languages, but also the transformation of any linguistic quality in general). The languages are merged, apparently creating a new language with each language as a subset, but the very advent of this union promotes the homogeneity of the overall set and the dissolution of any distinction between these subsets. To keep these non-distinct languages separate would be impossible, as it would involve a regression of the movement of thought to a moment before the translation. Once the translation has been acknowledged, the difference between languages is overcome. We may assume this to be true for every known language, even those not yet translated: the mere possibility of translation is enough to dispel the illusion of difference. So, we arrive at a similar conclusion to the previous argument: there is no word that can be spoken by man that is not part of a single, absolute language.”
    <br><br>The man stopped talking. The sun had set, and the world had turned from gray to black. Still, we waited with bated breath to see if he would begin again. After a few minutes, my companion asked:
    <br><br>“What were you muttering about?”
    <br><br>There was no reply. Although we could not see him in the darkness, we heard the squelch of the man’s boots as he limped away. `),
